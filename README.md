# 📌 Project Title

Multi-Algorithm Sorting Visualizer (Java, Swing)

Designed and developed a Java-based desktop application to visually demonstrate and compare multiple sorting algorithms executing simultaneously. The application uses Java Swing and multithreading to render real-time graphical animations of sorting processes such as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort on identical datasets. Each algorithm runs independently in parallel, enabling clear visual comparison of algorithmic behavior, time complexity patterns, and performance characteristics. The project enhances conceptual understanding of data structures and algorithms through interactive visualization and modular design.
